      <h3>Type as much of this paragraph as you can</h3>
      <p>
        I confess
        Here on my knee before high heaven and you,
        That before you, and next unto high heaven,
        I love your son.
        My friends were poor but honest; so's my love.
        Be not offended, for it hurts not him
        That he is loved of me. I follow him not
        By any token of presumptuous suit,
        Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;
        Yet never know how that desert should be.
        I know I love in vain, strive against hope;
        Yet in this captious and intensible sieve
        I still pour in the waters of my love
        And lack not to lose still. Thus, Indian-like,
        Religious in mine error, I adore
        The sun that looks upon his worshipper
        But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,
        Let not your hate encounter with my love,
        For loving where you do; but if yourself,
        Whose ag√®d honor cites a virtuous youth,
        Did ever in so true a flame of liking,
        Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian
        Was both herself and Love, O, then give pity
        To her whose state is such that cannot choose
        But lend and give where she is sure to lose;
        That seeks not to find that her search implies,
        But, riddle-like, lives sweetly where she dies.
